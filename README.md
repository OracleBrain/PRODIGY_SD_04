# Sudoku Solver

This project is a Sudoku solver program that automatically solves Sudoku puzzles. It takes an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and uses backtracking or other suitable techniques to fill in the missing numbers. Once solved, the program displays the completed Sudoku grid.

## Features

- **Automatic solving:** The program automatically solves Sudoku puzzles.
- **Backtracking:** It uses backtracking or other suitable techniques to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement of numbers.
- **User feedback:** The program informs the user whether the Sudoku puzzle was solved successfully or if no solution exists.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/oraclebrain/sudoku-solver.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd sudoku-solver
    ```

3. Compile the Java program:

    ```sh
    javac SudokuSolver.java
    ```

4. Run the program:

    ```sh
    java SudokuSolver
    ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to see the solved Sudoku puzzle.

## Code Overview

```java
public class SudokuSolver {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] board = {
            {5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0},
            {6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0},
            {0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0},
            {8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3},
            {4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1},
            {7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6},
            {0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0},
            {0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5},
            {0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9}
        };

        if (solveSudoku(board)) {
            System.out.println("TASK 02");
            System.out.println("The program is represented by Jeegnasa Makwana");
            System.out.println("Sudoku puzzle solved successfully!");
            printBoard(board);
        } else {
            System.out.println("No solution exists for the given Sudoku puzzle.");
        }
    }

    // Additional methods are omitted for brevity
}
```

- The `main` method initializes the Sudoku puzzle grid, attempts to solve it using the `solveSudoku` method, and displays the solved puzzle if successful.
- The `solveSudoku` method employs backtracking to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement of numbers.
- Additional methods such as `findEmptyCell`, `isValidMove`, and `printBoard` are used to support the solving process.
